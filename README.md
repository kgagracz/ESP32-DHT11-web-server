## Assumptions
The project aims to create a simple system for monitoring temperature and humidity in enclosed spaces. 
The main goal is to enable temperature measurement and air. The current data from the system will be displayed on a screen.
An additional functionality of the system will be sending email notifications to the user if measured values are detected outside the acceptable threshold ranges for temperature or humidity.
